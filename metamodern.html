          <i> Metamodern Media </i> was the final assignment for my Fall 2023
          Projects in Digital Composition class. We were tasked with creating an
          interactive kiosk display based on our chosen topic. Since the
          projects would be put on public display, they were meant to be as
          accessible and user-friendly as possible.

          Since I had to split my time between design and development, I wanted
          to make the initial designs very concise. My topic, "metamodernism",
          describes an emerging cultural philosophy - in other words, it can be
          pretty dense and difficult to understand. Most of my ideation was
          spent trying to distill it into a coherent format.

          <h3>Finding the Form</h3>
     
          <p>
            Showcasing media felt like the most straightforward way to explain
            metamodernism. Paired with a historical background/overview, the
            average person could gain an understanding without being
            overwhelmed. I really liked the idea of different modal windows for
            different media categories: it would reduce text on-screen, and keep
            the main screens mostly visual.  <span class="highlight"> My main source of inspiration came from Caleb Sun's
            <a style="color:black" href="https://vimeo.com/816712731" target="_blank">
              Guang Yu Kiosk Experience </a
            ></span>. I really loved the elegant method of displaying various
            artifacts, and how it's oriented for a touch-based experience.

          After bouncing around different ideas, my next step was to coalesce
          them into a prototype.
          <video class="mm_video" autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="metamodern\Lofi(1).mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </p>
        <p>
        I showed this prototype to my class and instructor for feedback. They gave me the following notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <p> The experience was easy to follow, but <span class="highlight"> didn't feel unique enough</span> </p></li>
          <li> <p> Modal windows were a good idea and should be further expanded on </p> </span> </li>
          <li> <p> Given the "out there" subject matter, the experience should also be breaking some boundaries: I should do more to <span class="highlight"> match function with meaning </span> </p> </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="container">
        <p> I addressed my feedback by creating unique interactions for each media type. Books emulated flash cards, movies emulated a video player, and art had tooltips. Though this approach definitely took more effort and the majority of my time, it elevated the project and led to people <span class="highlight"> expressing audible delight when interacting with it</span>.

        <p> Overall, I'm happy with how the project turned out in the amount of time I had.

There was material I cut due to the deadline, but designing for a kiosk was an interesting format that I want to return to. </p>
