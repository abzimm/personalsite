          Open Lab is a free-to-use makerspace on the University of Pittsburgh’s
          campus. It offers a variety of fabrication equipment and workshops to
          students, faculty, and staff. I was asked to redesign the website to
          make it more user friendly, as members frequently had trouble
          navigating through it.

        <h3><b>Context</b></h3>
        <p>
          The main purpose of the Open Lab website is for people to learn about
          how to become a member. Instead, students and faculty were coming into
          the physical location to ask staff directly. The common opener was:
          <span class="highlight">“I went to the website, but...”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Myself, the head of Open Lab, and three other staff members sat down
          to review the problems. Eventually, we outlined two main goals.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Differentiate student and faculty needs </b></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Remove bloat and outdated information </b></p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>First Impressions</h3>
        <p>
          The biggest problem we identified was the confusing landing section of
          the website. Newcomers to the site were instantly redirected to
          different links. This could work for someone who wanted an in-depth
          overview, but it was frustrating for people who wanted
          <span class="highlight"> simple questions answered</span>.

        <h3>Empathizing with New Members</h3>
        <p>
          To better understand what a clear user pathway could look like, I
          considered the unique pain points that students and faculty could
          have. Since I've worked at Open Lab for over a year, I was already
          familiar with many of the complaints people had about the website.
          Many users would view it out of curiosity, or because they had a
          specific project they wanted to create, but would often get lost in
          the abundance of links and redirects.

          <div>
            <h3><b> Solution: Focused Purpose </b></h3>
            <p>
              To remedy this,
              <span class="highlight">
                I distilled the site's purpose into two main actions </span
              >: how students can become a member, and how faculty can get
              consultations. This action-based approach would keep people on the
              site for longer and direct them to exactly what they needed to
              know. By using anchors, they wouldn't instantly be redirected to
              another window.

    <!-- 02 PROBLEM: OUTDATED INFORMATION -->

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Old Content</h3>
        <p>
          The second biggest problem was the outdated information. Since the
          site hadn't been updated for years, new pieces of equipment were
          nowhere to be found.
        </p>
        <div id="personas">

            <p>
              Additionally, clicking on the technology links brought users to a
              lengthy FAQ page. This was heavily
              <span class="highlight">redundant</span>, since the Canvas page
              covered all these details in a better, more modern fashion. In
              short - the additional pages conflated the purpose of the website
              with Open Lab's Canvas page, and as my stakeholders wanted things
              as simple as possible, we decided to cut these extra pages.

            <p>
              To account for the new additions and the succinct design goals, I
              then reduced this section to visual badges of each available
              service. By doing this, we could afford more scalability and
              display everything at a glance. It's a better portrayal of the
              <span class="highlight"> large variety</span> of technology at
              members' disposal, and cuts out any overlap with the Canvas page.

          granting them the freedom to do as they pleased.

        <h3>Layout Mockups</h3>
        <p>
          To convey a sense of what the site could look like, I created two
          layouts that mixed and match the components. With this design system,
          and with the clear user paths, most sections could be put in any order
          and assets easily moved around. I was able to provide the development
          team a proof of concept while leaving room for iteration and
          flexibility. This also satisfied the
          <span class="highlight">
            stakeholders' request to keep things as simple as possible,</span
          >
          leaving only the essential components of the site.
